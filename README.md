CS 360 - Mobile Architecture and Programming

**Course Description**

Students will apply mobile development principles and best practices to develop mobile applications using user-centered design principles and industry standards. Upon completion of a fully-functional mobile application, students will conduct security, product assuredness, and compatibility checks before launching the application.

**Course Competencies**

This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to your field:
* CS-30421: Apply mobile application development principles and best practices in the development of a mobile application
* CS-30422: Apply user-centered design principles and industry standards in the development of a mobile application
* CS-30423: Develop and launch a fully functional mobile application

**Module 8 Questions**
* **Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The app was designed to help users track their weight and set goals for their fitness journey. It allows them to log their weight, view progress, and receive notifications to stay on track.

* **What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

The app includes login/sign up screens, a main dashboard for navigating to weight history, a goal setting screen, and a notifications screen. The UI was kept simple, intuitive, and free of unnecessary clutter to make navigation easy. Staying within the core functionality, my design ensures users can quickly input and access their data without fuss.

* **How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**

I broke down each feature into smaller more manageable tasks and built the app in increments. I also followed best practices for structuring my code, prioritizing maintainability and scalability through modularity. This will be useful in future projects, allowing for efficient debugging and feature implementation/refinement.

* **How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**

I tested the app by running it in the Android Emulator, checking for errors, validating database operations, and ensuring all buttons and navigation worked as expected. This process revealed minor issues, such as UI alignment and logic errors, which were fixed before finalizing the project.

* **Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

One challenge was balancing features with usability, as some early ideas were too ambitious. To overcome this, I focused on core functionalities first, then refined the UI and added improvements when time allowed.

* **In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

I was particularly successful in implementing database CRUD functionality, enabling users to log, update, and delete their weight entries while keeping a clean and user friendly interface.
